# ICON_Drifts_Project

In here is all the code and plots I've worked on from the data analysis of MIGHTI and IVM. 
The main focus was on meridional drifts- and using the zonal wind profiles to create a Linear Regression based predictor for the drifts.
This was done primarily using Python's SKLearn package.
